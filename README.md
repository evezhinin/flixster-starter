### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics/lectures helped with useState and useEffect in react, specially the weather report lab as it helped me familiarize with reacts syntax. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If given more time, i would have added stretch features such as the side bar and used css to style it more. Maybe have done the search functionality differently. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Project demo went well, could have emphasized my voice tone, and explained in much more detail what Flixster is for and how API's are necessary.
